# Titanic Survival
In this, we have to use Machine Learning to build model that answers the question "what sorts of people were more likely to survive the infamous Titanic shipwreck?‚Äù 

## Features
Data Analysis: Getting more familiar with the data by getting to know various properties of the dataset

Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing the data so that it can be worked upon

Model Training: Using Supervised Machine Learning algorithms to build model
